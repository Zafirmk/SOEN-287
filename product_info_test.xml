				From taste to function, these minerals deliver the nutrients we expect from meat. Potassium Chloride is
				a naturally occurring mineral, added to provide a mineral balance close to that of animal meat. The
				flavors and colors in our food come from
				plants, and this means we donâ€™t use synthetic additives, for any reason, and we never will.

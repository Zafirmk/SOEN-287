				From taste to function, these minerals deliver the nutrients we expect from meat. Potassium Chloride is
				a naturally occurring mineral, added to provide a mineral balance close to that of animal meat. The
				flavors and colors in our food come from
				plants, and this means we don’t use synthetic additives, for any reason, and we never will.
